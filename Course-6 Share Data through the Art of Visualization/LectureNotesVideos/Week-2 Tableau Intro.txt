Hello again. We've already
discussed how helpful data visualizations can be
when we want to fit a lot of knowledge
into a small space. Now it's time to explore a
powerful tool that can help you create these visualizations and bring your data to life. It's called Tableau, a visual
analytics platform that makes it a lot easier to
explore and manage data. You might remember
hearing a bit about Tableau in some of our
earlier discussions, but you're about to
discover even more. Plus, when you get
comfortable with Tableau, you'll find it even easier
to use similar tools, giving you another skill that will help you stand
out in the job hunt. Coming up, we'll cover some of the features that make Tableau effective for visualizations and why it's used across industries. After that, the
fun really starts. We'll jump right in and
explore the Tableau interface, identifying and applying the various tools
it has to offer. I'll show you how to add data sources, control
visual elements, and work with a
variety of features that will make your
visualization really powerful. Like any software platform, there's some best
practices to keep in mind. So I'll show you
some examples of the good and the bad when it
comes to visualizations. We'll also get creative using color vision
deficiency palettes to make our visualizations
more accessible, and we'll show you how
multiple data sources can be combined to tell a
more comprehensive story. By the time we wrap up here, you'll be able to publish
your own visualizations on Tableau. I am so excited to lead
you on this Tableau tour. It's another useful tool that you'll be able to turn to as a future data analyst so that you can visualize and
published data you care about. After all, data has a story, and this is your chance
to share it with others. All right, let's discover
what it's all about.
