The skills section on your resume likely only has room for 2-4 bullet points, so be sure to use this space effectively. You might want to prioritize technical skills over soft skills. This is a great chance for you to highlight some of the skills you’ve picked up in these courses, such as:

Strong analytical skills
Pattern recognition
Relational databases and SQL
Strong data visualization skills
Proficiency with spreadsheets, SQL, R, and Tableau
Notice how the skills listed above communicate a well-rounded data analyst’s skill set without being wordy. The skills section summarizes what you’re capable of doing while listing the technology and tools you are proficient in.

Many companies use algorithms to screen and filter resumes for keywords. If your resume does not contain the keywords they are searching for, a human may never even read your resume. Reserving at least one bullet point to list specific programs you are familiar with is a great way to make sure your resume makes it past automated keyword screenings and onto the desk of a recruiter or hiring manager.

Take a moment to complete the skills section of your resume.
