Welcome back! While we're
learning about formatting data, I want to talk to you about another spreadsheet
feature: data validation. In this video, I'll
teach you a little bit about data validation and
show you how to use it. For now, when I say
data validation, I'm talking about the function, which is different from the
data validation process. We'll get into that later on. But first, let's talk about what data validation does
in spreadsheets. Basically, it allows
you to control what can and can't be entered
in your worksheet. Usually, data validation
is used to add drop-down lists to cells with predetermined options for
users to choose from. If you have a spreadsheet
with a lot of collaborators, this can make it
easier for them to interact with your table. You can think of it like a multiple choice
question on a quiz. Since you control what's being entered into the worksheet, it cuts down on how much data cleaning you have to do later on. Let's figure out how
we might do that. For this example, we'll
work on a project with a lot of milestones and
deadlines to keep track of. Let's say our team
has a spreadsheet that tracks everyone's progress. But instead of making
everyone write in where they are in their
task individually, we can provide a drop-down menu with multiple options, like "Not Yet Started," "In Progress,"
and "Ready." So we'll select the
column that we want to add the drop-down menus to, in this case, the "Status" column. Then we'll go to the
Data pull-down menu here at the top and
click "Data validation." This brings up a pop-up menu with options for data validation. In this case, we know
that we want to add a list of items for other
users to choose from. So we'll select the
"list of items" option from the possible criteria and type in the selections
we want to create. Then hit Save, and now all of
those cells have drop-down menus that we can use to easily mark progress
for each task. But there's other things
that you can do with data validation and
spreadsheets, too, like creating custom check boxes. To do this, let's select the cells under the
"Review" column to make a checkbox that will let us know if tasks have
been approved or not. We'll go back to the
data validation menu. But instead of
choosing "List from a range," we'll choose "Checkbox." There's an option to
use custom cell values. Let's choose that and put in "Approved" and "Not approved." Now these tasks can be checked off by whoever's reviewing them, like a project
manager, for example. Another way we can use
data validation is to protect structured
data and formulas. The more people that are working together in a spreadsheet, the more likely someone can
accidentally break a formula. But good news: the
data validation menu has an option to
reject invalid inputs, which helps make sure our custom tools will
continue to run correctly, even if someone puts the
wrong data in by mistake. All right, now you
know three uses for data validation
in your spreadsheets: adding drop-down lists,
creating custom checkboxes, and protecting structured
data and formulas. Data validation can help
your team track progress, protect your tables from breaking when working
in big teams, and help you customize
tables to your needs. Coming up, we'll learn more about conditional formatting
and some ways you can use conditional formatting and data validation
together. See you soon!
